# Intruder-Detection-System-with-ESP32-Stepper-Motor-and-Blynk-Integration
This project is an IoT-based security solution using the ESP32 microcontroller. It detects motion and unusual sounds with IR sensors and a sound sensor, triggers alarms via a buzzer, and rotates a stepper motor-controlled camera to monitor specific zones.
